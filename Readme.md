# Real-time Systems in Practice
> This repository contains implementations of a few common real-time system's mechanisms and basic concepts, is a simple version control and hosting for my personal learning projects.

There are two different ways and implementations that initially had different causes and needs, however both of them aim the same target - to learn how real-time systems can be programmed and used.

## micos
The `micos` directory contains general notes, description of several specific areas of real-time systems and implementations of practical assignments in context of using [MicroC/OS-II](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroC/OS-II). The work represented under this directory is done within a Real-time Systems course at the University of Applied Science Merseburg. 

Go directly to [my micos script](micos/Readme.md).

**Note:** the contained script is quite unstructured und not complete, may contain misleading information and was not reviewed, the implementations do not follow the best coding practices and this repo may only be considered as a personal version control and hosting system.

## freertos
The `freertos`directory contains the implementations of practical assignments, general instructions and description of the provided projects done within a Coursera course [Development of Real-Time Systems]( Åbo Akademi University) supported by  Åbo Akademi University.

Go directly to [freertos script](freertos/Readme.md).

>I can only express my best positive impressions about this course as it so far covers all aspects and details to provide basic (maybe also advanced) understanding of real-time systems in general and their fundamental principles I expected to learn in real-time systems. This course provides concise as well as very informative video lectures, offers diverse practical exercices and offers usage of free software for practical assignments. I have started this course as my main source for exam preparation, however would strongly recommend to take a look at this course as it not only refreshes the basic OS core principles, but also provides a better understanding of what real-time systems are, where are they used and how they work internally.
